<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tilt Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Pendulum</li><li>Liquid Pendulum</li><li>Gas Pendulum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tilt sensors measure the angle of inclination relative to gravity and come in three main types: solid pendulum, liquid pendulum, and gas pendulum. Solid pendulum sensors use a rigid mass that tilts with the device, providing a reliable angle reading. Liquid pendulum sensors contain a liquid that shifts within a container, offering sensitivity to small changes in tilt. Gas pendulum sensors utilize gas to detect tilt, making them ideal for extreme environments. Each type serves unique applications based on operational needs and precision requirements.</p></p>
