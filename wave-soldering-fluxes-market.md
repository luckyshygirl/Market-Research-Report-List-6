<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wave Soldering Fluxes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Corrosive</li><li>Noncorrosive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wave soldering fluxes are categorized into two main types: corrosive and noncorrosive fluxes. Corrosive fluxes contain halides that can promote solderability but may damage circuit boards over time due to their aggressive nature. Noncorrosive fluxes, on the other hand, are designed to be milder and do not leave harmful residues, making them ideal for sensitive electronic applications. The choice between these flux types impacts product reliability, manufacturing efficiency, and cleaning requirements in the wave soldering process.</p></p>
