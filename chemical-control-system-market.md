<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Control System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Control System</li><li>Closed Loop Control System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Open loop control system market refers to a system in which the control action is not dependent on the output. This means that the system does not react to changes in the output and there is no feedback loop. Closed loop control system market, on the other hand, refers to a system in which the control action is dependent on the output. This allows the system to continuously adjust and maintain a desired output by using feedback loops. Both types of control systems have their own applications and advantages in various industries.</p></p>
