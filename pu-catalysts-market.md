<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PU Catalysts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reactive Amine Catalysts</li><li>Non-reactive Amine Catalysts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the PU catalysts market, two primary types are identified: reactive amine catalysts and non-reactive amine catalysts. Reactive amine catalysts actively participate in the polyurethane curing process, enhancing the reaction rates by promoting interactions between isocyanates and polyols. Non-reactive amine catalysts, on the other hand, facilitate the reaction without undergoing permanent change, mainly accelerating the process through their presence rather than direct engagement. Both types play crucial roles in optimizing polyurethane formulations across various applications.</p></p>
