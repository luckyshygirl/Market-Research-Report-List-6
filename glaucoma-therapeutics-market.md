<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glaucoma Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prostaglandin Analogs</li><li>Beta Blockers</li><li>Alpha Agonists</li><li>Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glaucoma therapeutics market comprises several classes of medications. Prostaglandin analogs, such as latanoprost, enhance aqueous outflow, effectively lowering intraocular pressure. Beta blockers, like timolol, reduce aqueous humor production, thus diminishing pressure. Alpha agonists, such as brimonidine, work by both decreasing production and increasing outflow of aqueous humor. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, like dorzolamide, also reduce fluid production in the eye. Each class offers unique mechanisms of action, catering to diverse patient needs in managing glaucoma.</p></p>
