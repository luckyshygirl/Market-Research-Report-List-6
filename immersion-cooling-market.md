<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immersion Cooling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Phase Immersion Cooling</li><li>Two-Phase Immersion Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The immersion cooling market comprises two primary types: single-phase and two-phase immersion cooling. Single-phase immersion cooling submerges electronic components in a non-conductive liquid that remains in a single physical state, effectively dissipating heat. In contrast, two-phase immersion cooling utilizes a fluid that changes states—evaporating to absorb heat and condensing to release it—resulting in enhanced thermal efficiency. Both methods are gaining traction in data centers and high-performance computing for their superior cooling capabilities and energy efficiency.</p></p>
