<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) Thermistors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CPTC</li><li>PPTC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) thermistors can be classified into two main types - Conductive PTC (CPTC) and Polymer PTC (PPTC). CPTC thermistors exhibit a sharp increase in resistance when the temperature rises above a specific threshold, making them suitable for applications such as overcurrent protection in electric circuits. On the other hand, PPTC thermistors are made of polymer material and their resistance increases gradually with temperature, making them ideal for applications like self-regulating heating elements in electronics.</p></p>
