<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrostatic Wafer Chuck Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coulomb Type</li><li>Johnsen-Rahbek (JR) Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrostatic wafer chuck markets are divided into two main types: Coulomb Type and Johnsen-Rahbek (JR) Type. Coulomb Type chuck relies on the Coulomb forces between the chuck and the wafer for holding and releasing the wafer. On the other hand, JR Type chuck uses electrostatic forces combined with surface roughness to improve chucking stability. Both types cater to different needs in the semiconductor industry, with Coulomb Type providing a simpler solution and JR Type offering enhanced chucking performance.</p></p>
